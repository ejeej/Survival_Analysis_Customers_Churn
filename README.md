# Predicting customers' churn with survival analysis, including time-dependent variables

This study project was aimed at prediction of the probability of customers’ attrition (churn) with methods from survival analysis. In comparison with standard classification approaches resulted in prediction of churn as a binary target variable or probability of churn over some fixed period of time, survival analysis can be useful in understanding the dynamic of customer retention and attrition over time after some starting point (usually the start of relationship - contract, subscription, etc.). It can help in answering such questions as when clients churn the most, whether there are periods of increasing, stable or decreasing churn rates, as well as whether these all are different depending on customers’ characteristics, their behavior or some contract options.

The dataset for the project was taken from Kaggle competition [“WSDM - KKBox’s Churn Prediction Challenge”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge/) which was held in 2017. KKBox is an Asian company which offers subscription based music streaming service. The criteria of churn used in the competition is no new valid service subscription within 30 days after the current membership expires. We will use the same definition, although we will predict not just the probability of churn during the next 30 days after membership expiration as a binary outcome, but the distribution of time to churn and retention rates for different time points after the start of subscription. We will use models from both statistical analysis and machine learning, as well as both baseline features (available at the start of subscription) and time-dependent variables (information on user’s behavior during subscription).

Models with time-independent variables were estimated using library `scikit-survival` in Python, models with time-dependent variables - using libraries `survival` and `LTRCforest` in R.
